Our problem is not only valid in the game but also in the industrial world: the game serves as an example, the problem can then easily be mapped to a real infrastructure.  |Request|Amount|MaxConsumption|MaxSpace| |---|---|---|---| |SIMPLEX =|10|100|7*10| |Gives a list of recipes|for a given request|Use the list of recipes|to map out an optimal layout|  # Motivation  Online, we can find lots of models to optimize the space, but never with proper connection between the different facilities. Optimizing the space used in a factory is a relevant industry problem. Also, getting the expected output under the constraint of using the minimum amount of electricity is a current problem.  # Objectives  The objectives would be to be able to get a working model that can effectively map layout for a factory and connect the different buildings with the correct amount of belts in the smallest space possible:  # Approach  After retrieving the game data to know the possible crafts for each item, we solve with simplex using Gurobi and adding variables and constraints, to retrieve all the resources and machines needed: After that, we'll use Constraint Programming to plan the factory layout.  # Authors  Clercq Hugo & Laurez Andy  # Advisors  Augustin Delecluse & Guillaume Derval  # Supervisor  Pierre Schaus  UCLouvain 2022-2023 ",mip4 with a score of 0.48710915|simple-prod-planning with a score of 0.41531378|flattening9 with a score of 0.34831256|shipping with a score of 0.2995148127.0.0.1,True,20/11/2024 17:14:35,Can you answer the question in the document ?,"I have a car with a 80litre trunk.
