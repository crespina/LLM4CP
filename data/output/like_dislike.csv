172.31.19.200;True;1732828882.06873;How to schedule the upcoming exams ?;Timetabling Problem  This algorithm is used to schedule a set of events (exams) into a set of time slots, while taking into account constraints such as room availability, student conflicts, and exam duration. It can be applied to the exam scheduling problem by modeling the exams as events, the time slots as resources, and the constraints as rules to be satisfied. The algorithm will find a schedule that minimizes the total time required to complete all exams, while respecting the constraints.
