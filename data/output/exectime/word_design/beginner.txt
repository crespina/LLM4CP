DNA Word Design Problem

This problem is about designing a set of special words that can be used in DNA computing on surfaces. Imagine you have a set of Lego blocks with four different shapes (A, C, G, and T) and you want to build a collection of short words using these blocks.

The main variables are the words, which are like short sequences of these Lego blocks. Each word has 8 blocks, and each block can be one of the four shapes.

The basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:

* Each word must have exactly 4 blocks that are either C or G.
* Any two words in the collection must be different in at least 4 positions.
* When you reverse one word and compare it to another word, they must be different in at least 4 positions, following some specific rules about which blocks can be paired together (like A can be paired with T, and C can be paired with G).

The goal of the problem is to find the largest possible collection of words that follow these rules.
