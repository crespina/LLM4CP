Lam's Problem

This problem is about creating a special kind of table with certain rules.

The main variables are:

* A table (called a matrix) with rows and columns, where each cell can be either true or false.
* The size of the table, which is given to us.

The basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:

* Each row of the table must have exactly 11 true cells.
* Each column of the table must have exactly 11 true cells.
* For any two different rows, there must be exactly one column where one row has a true cell and the other row has a false cell.

The goal of the problem is to find a table that satisfies all these rules.
