Wagner-Whitin Distribution Problem

The Wagner-Whitin Distribution Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves managing inventory and distribution in a supply chain. It is a multi-period problem, meaning that decisions are made over a series of time periods.

The main decision variables in this problem are:

* `orders`: a matrix that represents the quantity of inventory ordered at each node (location) in each period.
* `stock`: a matrix that represents the inventory level at each node in each period.

The key constraints in this problem are:

* The initial inventory level at each node is zero.
* The inventory level at each non-leaf node (i.e., a node that has children) in each period is equal to the previous period's inventory level plus the quantity ordered minus the total quantity shipped to its children.
* The inventory level at each leaf node (i.e., a node that has no children) in each period is equal to the previous period's inventory level plus the quantity ordered minus the demand in that period.

The objective of the problem is to minimize the total cost, which consists of two components:

* Holding cost: the cost of holding inventory at each node in each period.
* Procurement cost: the cost of ordering inventory at each node in each period.

The problem is to determine the optimal ordering and inventory levels at each node in each period to meet the demand while minimizing the total cost.
