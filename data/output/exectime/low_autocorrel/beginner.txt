Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences

This problem is about creating a special kind of sequence of numbers that has a certain property. Imagine you have a list of numbers that can be either 1 or -1. The goal is to arrange these numbers in a specific order so that the sequence has low autocorrelation.

The main variables are:

* n: the length of the sequence (how many numbers are in the list)
* seq: the sequence of numbers itself (a list of 1s and -1s)

The basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:

* The sequence can only contain 1s and -1s.
* The sequence has a fixed length, which is given by the variable n.

The goal of the problem is to minimize the autocorrelation of the sequence. Autocorrelation measures how similar the sequence is to itself when shifted by a certain number of positions. In this case, we want to find a sequence that has low autocorrelation, meaning it doesn't repeat itself too much when shifted.
