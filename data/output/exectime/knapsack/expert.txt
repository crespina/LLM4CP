name: 0/1 Knapsack Problem

description: The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. It involves finding the optimal subset of items to include in a knapsack of limited capacity, such that the total value of the selected items is maximized.

variables: picked ∈ 2^items
The decision variable picked is a set of items, where each item is either selected (included in the knapsack) or not selected.

constraints: ∑(i ∈ picked) weight(i) ≤ capacity
The constraints ensure that the total weight of the selected items does not exceed the knapsack's capacity.

objective: maximize ∑(i ∈ picked) gain(i)
The objective is to maximize the total value (gain) of the selected items.
