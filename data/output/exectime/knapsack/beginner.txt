Knapsack Problem

Imagine you're going on a trip and you have a bag with a limited capacity. You have many items you want to bring, each with a weight and a value or gain. The problem is about deciding which items to pick to bring with you to maximize the total value while not exceeding the bag's capacity.

The main variables are:

* Items: the things you want to bring on the trip (e.g., clothes, books, etc.)
* Picked: the set of items you choose to bring
* Weight: how heavy each item is
* Gain: how valuable each item is
* Capacity: the maximum weight the bag can hold

The basic restrictions or rules are:

* You can't bring more items than the bag can hold (i.e., the total weight of the picked items must be less than or equal to the capacity).

The goal is to maximize the total value of the items you bring (i.e., the sum of the gains of the picked items).
