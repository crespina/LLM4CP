The 0/1 Knapsack Problem.

This problem is about selecting a subset of items to include in a knapsack of limited capacity, with the goal of maximizing the total value of the selected items while not exceeding the knapsack's weight capacity.

The main decision variables are the elements of the set `picked`, which represent the items that are selected to be included in the knapsack.

The key constraints are:

* The total weight of the selected items must not exceed the knapsack's capacity.
* Each item is either selected (included in the knapsack) or not selected.

The objective is to maximize the total gain (or value) of the selected items.

In essence, the problem is about making a selection of items that provides the highest value while staying within the weight constraints of the knapsack.
