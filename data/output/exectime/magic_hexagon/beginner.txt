Magic Hexagon

This problem is about creating a special kind of hexagon (a six-sided shape) where each cell in the hexagon contains a number. The goal is to arrange these numbers in a way that makes the sums of each row, column, and diagonal equal to a certain "magic number".

The main variables are:

* d: the diameter of the hexagon (how long the longest row is)
* o: the order of the hexagon (how long the shortest row is)
* hexagon: a matrix of numbers that represents the hexagon
* s: the magic number that all rows and diagonals sum to

The basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:

* Each number in the hexagon must be unique (no duplicates)
* Each row, column, and diagonal must add up to the magic number s
* The diameter d must be an odd number

The goal of the problem is to find a way to arrange the numbers in the hexagon so that all the rows, columns, and diagonals sum up to the magic number s.
