Imagine you have five types of materials (glass, plastic, steel, wood, and copper) and three types of bins (red, green, and blue). Each bin can hold a certain amount of material, and you need to put the right amount of each material into the bins.\n\nThe main variables are:\n\n* Materials: the five types of materials (glass, plastic, steel, wood, and copper)\n* Bins: the containers where the materials will be placed\n* Colour: the color of each bin (red, green, or blue)\n* Contents: the materials that are placed in each bin\n\nThe basic restrictions or rules of the problem are:\n\n* Each bin can only hold a certain amount of material\n* Certain materials cannot be placed in certain colored bins (e.g., plastic cannot be placed in red bins)\n* Some materials require other materials to be present (e.g., wood requires plastic)\n* Some materials exclude other materials (e.g., glass excludes copper)\n\nThe goal of the problem is to minimize the number of bins that are used to pack all the materials. In other words, we want to use as few bins as possible to pack all the materials while following the rules and restrictions.\n======\nDescription 2:\n------\nVellino's Problem\n\nVellino's Problem is a classic constraint programming problem that involves assigning materials to bins of different colors, subject to various constraints.\n\nThe main decision variables in this problem are:\n\n* `colour`: a function that assigns a color (red, green, or blue) to each bin\n* `contents`: a function that assigns a multiset of materials to each bin\n\nThe key constraints in this problem are:\n\n* Each bin must have a color and contents, or neither\n* The total amount of each material must be spread across all bins\n* The amount of material in each bin cannot exceed its capacity\n* Certain materials are incompatible with certain bin colors (e.g., red bins cannot contain plastic or steel)\n* Certain materials have specific requirements (e.g., wood requires plastic, glass excludes copper)\n* Some bins have limits on the number of wooden components they can contain\n\nThe objective of this problem is to minimize the number of bins that have colors and materials assigned to them.\n\nIn essence, Vellino's Problem is a complex bin packing problem with additional constraints on material compatibility and requirements. It requires finding an optimal assignment of materials to bins that satisfies all the constraints and minimizes the number of used bins.\n======\nDescription 3:\n------\nname: Vellino's Problem\n\ndescription: Vellino's Problem is a classic constraint satisfaction problem that involves assigning materials to bins of different colors, subject to various constraints on the capacity of the bins, the compatibility of materials with bin colors, and the co-occurrence of certain materials.\n\nvariables: colour: Bin \u2192 Colour, contents: Bin \u2192 mset(Material)\n\nThe decision variables are `colour` and `contents`. `colour` assigns a color (red, green, or blue) to each bin, and `contents` assigns a multiset of materials (glass, plastic, steel, wood, or copper) to each bin.\n\nconstraints: \nb \u2208 defined(colour) \u2194 b \u2208 defined(contents) \u2200b \u2208 Bin\n\u2211b \u2208 defined(contents) freq(contents(b), m) = quantity(m) \u2200m \u2208 Material\n|contents(b)| \u2264 capacity(colour(b)) \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\ncolour(b) = red \u2192 \u00ac(plastic \u2208 contents(b)) \u2227 \u00ac(steel \u2208 contents(b)) \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\ncolour(b) = blue \u2192 \u00ac(wood \u2208 contents(b)) \u2227 \u00ac(plastic \u2208 contents(b)) \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\ncolour(b) = green \u2192 \u00ac(steel \u2208 contents(b)) \u2227 \u00ac(glass \u2208 contents(b)) \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\ncolour(b) = red \u2192 freq(contents(b), wood) \u2264 1 \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\ncolour(b) = green \u2192 freq(contents(b), wood) \u2264 2 \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\nwood \u2208 contents(b) \u2192 plastic \u2208 contents(b) \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\nglass \u2208 contents(b) \u2192 \u00ac(copper \u2208 contents(b)) \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\ncopper \u2208 contents(b) \u2192 \u00ac(plastic \u2208 contents(b)) \u2200b \u2208 defined(colour)\n\nThe constraints ensure that each bin has a color if and only if it has contents, the total amount of each material is spread across all bins, the capacity of each bin is not exceeded, and the various material-color and material-material incompatibilities are respected.\n\nobjective: minimize |defined(colour)|\n\nThe objective is to minimize the number of bins that have colors and materials assigned to them.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 7703, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "957b126e-0e5c-4ff1-8f51-da9efa8c37c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "957b126e-0e5c-4ff1-8f51-da9efa8c37c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"model_name": "wagner"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "wagner_beginner_medium_expert", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"model_name": "wagner"}, "hash": "314085a0e5d3e7f0be83f696c130f94c1e384769bd6f66b33cde4ef9881ee2e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Source code:\n------\nlanguage Essence 1.3\n \n$ ** Updates **\n$ 2021/08/04 - The new model 'DistributionWagnerWhitin-partialfunc.essence' performances\n$              signficantly better in practice.\n \n$ Problem Wagner-Whitin Distribution\n$\n$ Problem details available at http://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob040/\n$\n$ Essence model by Andrew Martin\n$\n$ Licenced under CC-BY-4.0 : http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n \n$ in this model, rather than define multiple levels, children of each node are defined explicitly\n \ngiven numNodes : int(1..)\n \n$ leaves are always first numLeaves nodes\n$ leaves cannot have any children\ngiven numLeaves : int(1..)\n \n$ period 0 is empty, all stock is 0\ngiven numPeriods : int(1..)\n \n$ used to provide bound to output\ngiven maxStock : int(1..)\n \nletting dNodes be domain int(1..numNodes)\nletting dLeaves be domain int(1..numLeaves)\nletting dAllPeriods be domain int(0..numPeriods)\nletting dPeriods be domain int(1..numPeriods)\n \ngiven holdingCost : matrix indexed by [dNodes] of int(0..)\n \ngiven procCost : matrix indexed by [dNodes] of int(0..)\n \ngiven demand : matrix indexed by [dLeaves, dPeriods] of int(0..)\n \n$ used to determine where supply comes goes to\ngiven children : matrix indexed by [dNodes] of set of dNodes\n \nfind orders : matrix indexed by [dNodes, dPeriods] of int(0..maxStock)\n \n$ AUX find statement\nfind stock : matrix indexed by [dNodes, dAllPeriods] of int(0..maxStock)\n \n$ minimising the cost\n$ holding*stock per period per node plus proc if any orders were placed per period per node\nminimising (sum t : dPeriods .
