We have 5 ships arriving today, each carrying a different type of cargo. The cargo is classified into different categories based on its priority, with 1 being the lowest priority and 5 being the highest. The priority of each ship's cargo is [3, 5, 2, 3, 1]. However, we have a constraint that the ship with the longest unloading time must be unloaded before the ship with the shortest unloading time. Additionally, we have to consider the fact that the ships are arriving at different times, and we want to minimize the waiting time for each ship. We also have to take into account the availability of the dockworkers, who are responsible for unloading the cargo. Given these constraints, how can I schedule the unloading of the ships to minimize the waiting time and satisfy the constraint? I want to make sure that the ship with the highest priority cargo is unloaded first, the ship with the second highest priority cargo is unloaded second, and so on. Can you help me figure out the optimal schedule?\"\n}\n```"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "{\n  \"name\": \"Job Scheduling Problem\",\n  \"description\": \"The Job Scheduling Problem is a classic problem in constraint programming.
